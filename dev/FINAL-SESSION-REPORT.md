## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### What Works:
✅ Start node - passes input  
✅ Agent node - full LLM integration  
✅ End node - workflow completion  
✅ Transform node - JavaScript execution  
✅ Set State node - state management  
✅ Model selection - different models work  
✅ Instructions - affect behavior  
✅ Chat history - toggle works  
✅ Data flow - Start → Agent works  

### What's Partial:
⚠️ If/Else - code exists, untested  
⚠️ While - complex logic, untested  
⚠️ Voice/TTS - needs external server  

### What Doesn't Work:
❌ File Search - stub (returns input)  
❌ Guardrails - stub (returns input)  
❌ MCP - stub (returns input)  
❌ User Approval - stub (auto-approves)  
❌ Note - visual only  
❌ Tools - don't execute (Bug #2)  

---

## 💡 Critical Insights

### Implementation Quality:
1. **Agent node** - Excellent (50+ lines, full featured)
2. **Transform node** - Good (15 lines, clean)
3. **While node** - Complex (60+ lines, needs testing)
4. **Stub nodes** - Placeholders only

### Security Concerns:
- ⚠️ Transform uses `new Function()` (eval-like)
- ⚠️ No input sanitization
- ⚠️ While could infinite loop (has max iterations)

### Architecture:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Each node has dedicated execute method
- Context passed through workflow
- Good error handling structure
