# 🌐 Multi-Domain Expert System

**Type:** Parallel Multi-Agent System  
**Complexity:** Very High (50+ nodes potential)  
**Purpose:** Analyze complex problems from multiple expert perspectives simultaneously

---

## 🎯 Concept Overview

This system demonstrates **parallel agent processing** where multiple expert agents analyze the same problem simultaneously from different domains, then synthesize their findings.

**Use Case:** Business Decision Analysis

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Phase 1: Problem Decomposition
```
Start → Problem Analyzer → Domain Identifier → Task Splitter
```

**Output:** Problem broken into domain-specific sub-problems

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Expert Analysis (5 branches)

```
                    ┌─→ Financial Expert → Financial Analysis
                    │
                    ├─→ Technical Expert → Technical Analysis
                    │
Problem Split ──────┼─→ Legal Expert → Legal Analysis
                    │
                    ├─→ Market Expert → Market Analysis
                    │
                    └─→ Risk Expert → Risk Analysis
                         
                    ↓ (All converge)
                    
                Synthesis Agent
```

**Features:**
- ✅ 5 parallel expert branches
- ✅ Each expert has specialized knowledge
- ✅ Independent analysis
- ✅ Converge for synthesis

---

### Phase 3: Cross-Domain Validation

```
Synthesis → Conflict Detector → 
(Conflicts Found? → Expert Debate → Resolution → Re-synthesis)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Detects contradictions between experts
- ✅ Facilitates expert debate
- ✅ Resolves conflicts through consensus

---

### Phase 4: Scenario Modeling

```
For each scenario (3-5):
  → Scenario Builder
  → Impact Analyzer (per domain)
  → Risk Scorer
  → Recommendation Generator
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Multiple scenario analysis
- ✅ Impact assessment per domain
- ✅ Risk quantification
- ✅ Actionable recommendations

**Parallel Analysis:**
- **Technical Expert:** Breach scope, containment, remediation
- **Legal Expert:** Notification requirements, liability exposure
- **Financial Expert:** Cost impact, insurance claims
- **PR Expert:** Communication strategy, reputation management
- **Risk Expert:** Future prevention, security improvements

**Output:** Immediate action plan + long-term strategy

```

### Pattern 2: Hierarchical Experts
```
Financial Expert
  ├─→ Cost Analyst
  ├─→ Revenue Analyst
  ├─→ Investment Analyst
  └─→ Tax Specialist
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Stage Analysis
```
Stage 1: Initial Analysis (20 nodes)
Stage 2: Deep Dive (30 nodes)
Stage 3: Validation (20 nodes)
Stage 4: Recommendations (20 nodes)
Stage 5: Implementation Planning (20 nodes)
```

### Pattern 4: Iterative Refinement
```
Round 1: Broad analysis (all experts)
Round 2: Focus on conflicts (subset)
Round 3: Deep dive on critical areas
Round 4: Final recommendations
```

## 🔄 Complex Patterns

### 1. Parallel-Converge-Parallel
```
Split → [5 parallel experts] → Synthesize → 
Split → [3 scenario analyses] → Synthesize → 
Split → [5 implementation plans] → Final
```

### 2. Conditional Expert Routing
```
Problem Type?
  → Financial → [Financial experts]
  → Technical → [Technical experts]
  → Legal → [Legal experts]
  → Mixed → [All experts]
```

### 3. Expert Voting System
```
Each expert votes: Approve/Reject/Abstain
Tally votes → Majority wins
Minority experts → Provide dissenting opinions
```

### 4. Confidence-Weighted Synthesis
```
Each expert provides confidence score (0-100%)
Synthesis weights opinions by confidence
High-confidence opinions have more influence
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Expert Selection
```javascript
// Select experts based on problem type
if (problem.includes('financial')) {
  experts.push('CFO', 'Accountant', 'Investor');
}
if (problem.includes('technical')) {
  experts.push('CTO', 'Architect', 'Engineer');
}
```

### 2. Expert Memory & Learning
```javascript
// Experts remember past analyses
expert.history.push(current_analysis);
expert.learn_from(feedback);
```

### 3. Collaborative Refinement
```javascript
// Experts review each other's work
expert1_analysis → expert2_reviews → expert1_refines
```

### 4. Consensus Building
```javascript
// Iterate until consensus reached
while (disagreement_level > threshold && iterations < max) {
  experts_debate();
  refine_positions();
  check_consensus();
}

## 🚀 Implementation Tips

### 1. Use State for Coordination
```javascript
state.expert_analyses = {
  financial: {...},
  technical: {...},
  legal: {...}
};
```

### 2. Use Transforms for Routing
```javascript
// Route to appropriate experts
const experts = determineExperts(problem);
return JSON.stringify(experts);
```

### 3. Use While Loops for Consensus
```javascript
// Iterate until agreement
while (consensus_score < 0.8 && iterations < 5) {
  refine_analyses();
}
```

### 4. Use If/Else for Decisions
```javascript
// Route based on confidence
if (confidence > 0.9) {
  → Approve
} else if (confidence > 0.7) {
  → Review
} else {
  → Reject
}
```
