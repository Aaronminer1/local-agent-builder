## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Nodes 1-7)
```
Start → Input Parser → Store Request → Research Planner → 
Store Plan → Init Counter → Store Counter
```

**Purpose:** Parse user request, create research plan, initialize loop state

**Agents:**
1. **Input Parser** - Extracts topic, depth, format, key questions
2. **Research Planner** - Creates 3-5 focused research questions

---

### Phase 2: Research Loop (Nodes 8-15)
```
While Loop ↔ [Extract Question → Researcher → Fact Checker → 
Quality Check → (Pass: Store | Fail: Retry) → Update Counter] → Loop
```

**Purpose:** Iteratively research each question with quality validation

**Agents:**
3. **Researcher** - Deep research on specific question
4. **Fact Checker** - Validates accuracy, rates confidence
5. **Retry Research** - Re-researches if quality is low

**Features:**
- ✅ Loops up to 5 questions (configurable)
- ✅ Quality gate (high/medium confidence passes)
- ✅ Automatic retry for low-quality research
- ✅ Accumulates research data in state

---

### Phase 3: Content Creation (Nodes 16-19)
```
Synthesizer → Outline Creator → Content Writer → Editor
```

**Purpose:** Transform research into structured, polished content

**Agents:**
6. **Synthesizer** - Connects ideas, identifies patterns
7. **Outline Creator** - Creates structured outline
8. **Content Writer** - Writes 500-800 word content
9. **Editor** - Polishes for clarity and flow

---

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Nodes 20-23)
```
Quality Scorer → Quality Gate → 
(Pass: Formatter | Fail: Check Iterations → Retry or Accept)
```

**Purpose:** Ensure content meets quality standards

**Agents:**
10. **Quality Scorer** - Rates on 4 dimensions (1-10 each)

**Features:**
- ✅ Quality threshold: Average ≥ 7
- ✅ Up to 2 improvement iterations
- ✅ Automatic retry with feedback

---

### Phase 5: Finalization (Nodes 24-28)
```
Formatter → Metadata Generator → Package Output → 
User Approval → Guardrails → End
```

**Purpose:** Format, add metadata, human review, safety check

**Agents:**
11. **Formatter** - Adds title, summary, headers, references
12. **Metadata Generator** - Word count, tags, difficulty, audience

**Features:**
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop approval
- ✅ Content safety guardrails
- ✅ Structured JSON output

```javascript
{
  research_request: {},      // Parsed user input
  research_plan: "",         // List of questions
  loop_state: {              // Loop tracking
    question_num: 1,
    max_questions: 5,
    research_data: []
  },
  improvement_iterations: 0, // Quality retry count
  metadata: {}               // Final metadata
}
```

### 5. Decision Trees
- **Quality Check:** Route to retry or continue
- **Quality Gate:** Route to format or improve
- **Iteration Check:** Route to retry or accept

## 🚀 How It Works

### Example Execution Flow

**Input:** "Research the benefits of meditation"

1. **Input Parser** extracts:
   - Topic: "meditation benefits"
   - Depth: "intermediate"
   - Format: "article"

   - What are the proven health benefits?
   - How does meditation affect the brain?
   - What are the different types?
   - What does research say about effectiveness?
   - How to get started?

3. **Research Loop** (5 iterations):
   - Question 1 → Research → Fact Check → ✅ Pass → Store
   - Question 2 → Research → Fact Check → ✅ Pass → Store

## 💡 Advanced Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Loop with Accumulation
```javascript
// Research loop accumulates data
loop_state.research_data.push(new_research);
loop_state.question_num++;
```

### 2. Quality-Based Branching
```javascript
// Route based on quality score
if (confidence === 'high' || confidence === 'medium') {
  → Continue
} else {
  → Retry
}
```

### 3. Bounded Iteration
```javascript
// Prevent infinite improvement loops
if (iterations < 2) {
  → Retry
} else {
  → Accept (good enough)
}
```

### 4. State-Driven Decisions
```javascript
// Use accumulated state for decisions
const loopState = JSON.parse(state.loop_state);
return loopState.question_num <= loopState.max_questions;
```

### 5. Multi-Stage Pipeline
```
Research → Validation → Synthesis → Creation → 
Editing → Scoring → Formatting → Review
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adjust Research Depth
Change `max_questions` in init-counter:
```javascript
{ question_num: 1, max_questions: 10, research_data: [] }
```

### Adjust Quality Threshold
Change quality-gate condition:
```javascript
return score >= 8; // Stricter (was 7)
```

### Adjust Improvement Iterations
Change improvement-loop-check:
```javascript
return iterations < 3; // More retries (was 2)
```

### Change Content Length
Modify content-writer instructions:
```
Aim for 1000-1500 words. // (was 500-800)
```
