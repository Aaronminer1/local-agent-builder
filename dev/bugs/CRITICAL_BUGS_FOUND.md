## 🚨 Bug #1: Input State Not Syncing with UI

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Workflow cannot be executed  
**Status:** CONFIRMED

### Description:
The input textarea shows text in the DOM, but React state (`userInput`) is not being updated. This causes the validation to always fail, preventing workflow execution.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type text in the input textarea
2. Click "Run" button
3. Alert appears: "Please enter an input before running the workflow"
4. Input IS visible in the UI but state is empty

### Expected Behavior:
- Typing in textarea should update `userInput` state
- Validation should pass when text is present
- Workflow should execute

### Actual Behavior:
- DOM value updates (visible in UI)
- React state does NOT update
- Validation always fails
- Workflow never executes

### Root Cause:
Likely issue with `onChange` handler in Builder.tsx line 374:
```typescript
<textarea
  value={userInput}
  onChange={(e) => setUserInput(e.target.value)}
  // ...
/>
```

### Possible Causes:
1. Component re-rendering issue
2. State not properly initialized
3. Event handler not firing
4. Stale closure capturing old state

### Testing Notes:
- Playwright's `.fill()` doesn't trigger React onChange
- `.pressSequentially()` should trigger onChange but state still doesn't update
- DOM inspection shows value is present
- React state inspection needed

### Fix Priority: 🔴 IMMEDIATE
This completely blocks workflow execution!

## 🚨 Bug #2: Tools Don't Execute (Previously Identified)

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Tools are cosmetic only  
**Status:** CONFIRMED

### Description:
Tools can be selected in UI but are never used during workflow execution.

### What Works:
- ✅ Tool selection UI
- ✅ Adding/removing tools
- ✅ Tools save to node data

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Tools never read from node data
- ❌ Tools never passed to LLM
- ❌ Tools don't affect agent behavior

### Fix Priority: 🟠 HIGH
Users expect tools to work, but they don't.

## 🔍 Bugs to Investigate

### Bug #3: Do Node Settings Actually Affect Execution?

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Does changing the model actually use a different model?
2. Does "Include chat history" actually include history?
3. Does changing instructions actually change behavior?
4. Does temperature setting work?
5. Does output format (Text vs JSON) work?

**Status:** NOT YET TESTED

---

### Bug #4: Do Connections Work Correctly?

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Does output from Start reach Agent?
2. Does output from Agent reach End?
3. Do multiple agents pass data correctly?
4. Do If/Else branches work?
5. Do While loops work?

**Status:** NOT YET TESTED

---

### Bug #5: Does Data Persist Correctly?

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Do workflow settings save?
2. Do node configurations persist?
3. Do tools persist after reload?
4. Does input persist?
5. Do execution logs persist?

**Status:** NOT YET TESTED

---

### Bug #6: Does the Inspector Update Correctly?

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Does clicking a node show correct settings?
2. Do changes in inspector save to node?
3. Do changes reflect immediately?
4. Does switching between nodes work?

**Status:** NOT YET TESTED

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### What We Learned:
**Don't just test "does it click" - test "does it work"**

### Questions to Always Ask:
1. **Does the UI update?** ✅ (We tested this)
2. **Does the state update?** ❌ (We found a bug!)
3. **Does the data persist?** ⏳ (Need to test)
4. **Does it affect behavior?** ⏳ (Need to test)
5. **Does it work end-to-end?** ⏳ (Need to test)

### Testing Levels:
1. **Level 1: UI** - Does it look right?
2. **Level 2: State** - Does data update?
3. **Level 3: Persistence** - Does it save?
4. **Level 4: Execution** - Does it actually work?
5. **Level 5: Integration** - Does everything work together?

We were testing Level 1. We need to test all 5 levels!

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Input State Bug (30 minutes)
**Priority:** 🔴 IMMEDIATE

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Add console.log to onChange handler
2. Check if handler is firing
3. Check if setUserInput is being called
4. Check React DevTools for state value
5. Look for competing state updates

**Possible Fixes:**
- Add useCallback to onChange handler
- Check for conflicting useEffect
- Verify no stale closures
- Check component re-render logic

### 2. Add Debug Logging (15 minutes)
**Priority:** 🔴 IMMEDIATE

Add logging to track:
- Input changes
- State updates
- Validation checks
- Execution flow

### 3. Continue End-to-End Testing (2 hours)
**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

Test all remaining functionality:
- Node settings
- Connections
- Persistence
- Inspector
- Execution flow

## 💡 Key Insights

### What This Testing Revealed:
1. **UI ≠ Functionality** - Things can look right but not work
2. **State management is critical** - React state must sync with UI
3. **Validation can hide bugs** - The validation worked, but exposed the real bug
4. **End-to-end testing is essential** - Unit tests wouldn't catch this

### Why This Matters:
- Users will try to use the app
- They'll type input and click Run
- It will fail every time
- They'll think the app is broken
- **Because it is!**
