# Bug #1: Input State Not Syncing - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

## Problem

Input textarea showed text in the DOM, but React state (`userInput`) was not being updated. This caused validation to always fail, preventing workflow execution.

**Symptoms:**
- User types in input textarea
- Text appears in UI
- Click "Run" button
- Alert: "Please enter an input before running the workflow"
- Workflow never executes

---

## Root Cause

**Stale Closure in useCallback**

The `handleExecute` function was wrapped in `useCallback` with an incomplete dependency array:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const handleExecute = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!userInput.trim()) {  // Always sees initial empty value!
    alert('Please enter an input before running the workflow');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}, [nodes, edges, isExecuting]);  // ‚ùå Missing userInput!
```

The dependency array was `[nodes, edges, isExecuting]` but **missing `userInput`**.

This created a stale closure where `handleExecute` always captured the initial empty value of `userInput`, even though the state was actually updating correctly.

---

## Solution

**Add `userInput` to dependency array:**

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const handleExecute = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!userInput.trim()) {  // Now sees current value!
    alert('Please enter an input before running the workflow');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}, [nodes, edges, isExecuting, userInput]);  // ‚úÖ Added userInput!
```

**File:** `/agent-builder/src/pages/Builder.tsx`  
**Line:** 147  
**Change:** Added `userInput` to dependency array

## Testing

### Test 1: Basic Execution
1. Typed "Hello world" in input
2. Clicked "Run"
3. ‚úÖ Workflow executed successfully
4. ‚úÖ Result: "Hello back to you! How's your day going so far?"

### Test 2: Execution Logs
‚úÖ Start node executed (5ms)  
‚úÖ Agent node executed (2036ms)  
‚úÖ Logs displayed correctly

### Test 3: Console Output
‚úÖ No errors  
‚úÖ Proper execution flow  
‚úÖ LLM called with llama3.1:8b

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Workflows could not execute
- ‚ùå Complete blocker for all testing
- ‚ùå 0% functionality

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Workflows execute successfully
- ‚úÖ Input flows through correctly
- ‚úÖ Agent responds properly
- ‚úÖ 100% functionality restored

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Incomplete dependency array** in useCallback
2. **Stale closure** captured old state
3. **React DevTools would have caught this** (should use in future)

### How to Prevent:
1. ‚úÖ Always include all dependencies in useCallback/useMemo
2. ‚úÖ Use ESLint rule: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
3. ‚úÖ Test with React DevTools to inspect state
4. ‚úÖ Add console.log to verify state values

### Testing Philosophy:
- ‚úÖ Test the actual behavior, not just the UI
- ‚úÖ Verify state updates, not just DOM updates
- ‚úÖ Test end-to-end flow
