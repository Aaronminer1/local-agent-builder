# Bug #3: Transform Node Not Executing - FIXED ✅

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date Fixed:** October 9, 2025, 11:03 PM  
**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH  
**Time to Fix:** 10 minutes

---

## Problem

Transform node was not executing JavaScript code due to property name mismatch.

---

## Root Cause

**Property Name Mismatch:**
- UI saves transform code as: `node.data.code`
- Executor was reading: `node.data.transformCode`

**Result:** Code was never found, so Transform just returned input unchanged.

---

## Solution

Changed line 294 in `workflowExecutor.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const transformCode = node.data?.transformCode as string | undefined;

// AFTER (FIXED):
const transformCode = node.data?.code as string | undefined;
```

**File:** `/agent-builder/src/services/workflowExecutor.ts`  
**Line:** 294  
**Change:** `transformCode` → `code`

---

## Test Results

**Test:** Transform Node JavaScript Execution  
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Workflow:** Start → Transform → Agent → End

**Configuration:**
- Input: "10"
- Transform code: `return parseInt(input) * 2;`

**Execution Logs:**
```
[11:03:23 PM] 🚀 Start (5ms)
Output: 10

[11:03:23 PM] Transform (4ms)
Output: 20  ✅ CORRECT!

[11:03:24 PM] 🤖 AI Agent (1080ms)
Output: [talks about 20]

[11:03:24 PM] Node (1ms)
Output: [agent output]
```

**Result:** ✅ Transform executed JavaScript correctly!  
**10 * 2 = 20** ✅

---

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Transform node didn't work
- ❌ No data transformation possible
- ❌ JavaScript code ignored

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Transform node works perfectly
- ✅ JavaScript execution confirmed
- ✅ Data transformation works
- ✅ All 4 nodes in workflow work!

---

## Verified Working

✅ Start node  
✅ **Transform node** (JavaScript execution)  
✅ Agent node  
✅ End node  
✅ Data flow through all 4 nodes  
✅ Workflow completes successfully  

---

## Additional Findings

**Delete Button Found:**
- Each node HAS a delete button (🗑️)
- Located in the inspector panel
- Works correctly

**End Node Works:**
- Executes in 1ms
- Passes through data
- Logs "🏁 Workflow completed"

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED  
**Bugs Fixed This Session:** 2 (Input state + Transform)  
**Nodes Tested:** 4/13 (Start, Transform, Agent, End)
