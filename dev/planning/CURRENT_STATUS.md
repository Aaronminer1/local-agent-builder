# Current Status - Local Agent Builder

**Last Updated:** October 9, 2025, 10:13 PM  
**Version:** 0.2.0-dev  
**Status:** 🟡 Partially Functional - Critical Bugs Found

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

**What Works:**
- ✅ All 13 node types render correctly
- ✅ Tool selection UI (add/remove tools)
- ✅ Input panel UI
- ✅ Node connections
- ✅ Save/load workflows

**What's Broken:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** Input state doesn't sync - workflows can't execute
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** Tools don't actually execute - they're cosmetic only

**Next Priority:**
1. Fix input state bug (blocks everything)
2. Test if node settings work
3. Implement tool execution

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Blocking)

**Bug #1: Input State Not Syncing**
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Workflows cannot execute

  - User types in input textarea
  - DOM updates (text visible)
  - React state (`userInput`) does NOT update
  - Validation always fails
  - Alert: "Please enter an input before running the workflow"
- **Root Cause:** Unknown - investigating
- **Priority:** IMMEDIATE
- **File:** `/agent-builder/src/pages/Builder.tsx` line 374

**Bug #2: Tools Don't Execute**
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Tools are cosmetic only
- **Status:** Confirmed, not fixed
- **Details:**
  - Tools can be selected in UI
  - Tools save to node data
  - Tools are NEVER read during execution
  - `executeAgent()` doesn't check for tools
  - No tool execution logic exists
- **Root Cause:** Not implemented
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **File:** `/agent-builder/src/services/workflowExecutor.ts` line 217

## 🎯 Current Priorities

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Fix input state bug** - Blocks all execution
2. **Test node settings** - Do they actually work?
3. **Document all findings** - Update this file

### Short Term (This Week):
1. **Implement tool execution** - Make tools actually work
2. **Add warning badges** - "Tools not yet executed"
3. **Test all node types** - Verify they work end-to-end

### Medium Term (Next Week):
1. **Phase 2 features** - Toggle switches, collapsible sections
2. **Workflow actions** - Duplicate, rename, delete
3. **Undo/Redo** - History management

## 📝 Notes

### What We Learned:
1. **UI ≠ Functionality** - Things can look right but not work
2. **Test thoroughly** - Don't just test if buttons click
3. **State management is critical** - React state must sync
4. **End-to-end testing is essential** - Unit tests miss integration bugs

### What's Next:
1. Fix the input state bug
2. Continue comprehensive testing
3. Document all findings
4. Create fix plan
5. Implement fixes systematically
