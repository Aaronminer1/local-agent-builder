### 4. **MCP Server Comparison**

#### Our Built-in MCP Servers (12 Total)

**✅ No Authentication Required (5 servers):**
1. **Sequential Thinking** - Step-by-step reasoning
2. **Playwright** - Browser automation (our specialty!)
3. **Filesystem** - Local file operations
4. **Memory** - Context storage
5. **Fetch** - HTTP requests

**🔑 Authentication Required (7 servers):**
1. **Brave Search** - Web search (needs BRAVE_API_KEY)
2. **Google Maps** - Location services (needs GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)
3. **Slack** - Team communication (needs SLACK_TOKEN)
4. **GitHub** - Repository access (needs GITHUB_TOKEN)
5. **Gmail** - Email integration (needs OAUTH)
6. **Google Drive** - Cloud storage (needs OAUTH)
7. **Google Calendar** - Calendar (needs OAUTH)

#### OpenAI's MCP Support
- Access to OpenAI's connector library

**Our Advantage**: Direct Playwright access without MCP overhead

---

### 5. **Playwright Usage Comparison**

#### OpenAI's Approach
```typescript
// Must use MCP connector
// Limited to MCP API surface
// Indirect access through connector layer
MCP Node → Playwright Connector → Browser
```

**Limitations:**
- Can't access all Playwright features
- Dependent on MCP server availability
- Less control over browser behavior
- May have rate limits

#### Our Approach
```typescript
// Direct Playwright integration
// Full API access
// Custom browser automation
Agent → Playwright MCP → Direct Browser Control

// Example: Advanced usage
{
  type: 'mcp',
  serverName: 'playwright',
  operation: 'navigate_and_screenshot',
  config: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    fullPage: true,
    selector: '.main-content',
    waitFor: 'networkidle'
  }
}
```

**Advantages:**
✅ Full Playwright API (1000+ methods)  
✅ Custom scripts and automation  
✅ Network interception  
✅ Mobile emulation  
✅ PDF generation  
✅ Video recording  
✅ Geolocation spoofing  
✅ Custom browser contexts
