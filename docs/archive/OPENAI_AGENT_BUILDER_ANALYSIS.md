# OpenAI Agent Builder - Analysis & Implementation Guide
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** Understanding how OpenAI's Agent Builder works to guide our local implementation

---

## 📚 Key Learnings from Documentation

### Core Concepts

**What is Agent Builder?**
- Visual canvas for building multi-step agent workflows
- Drag-and-drop interface for composing workflows
- Nodes connected by typed edges
- Preview/debug with live data
- Deploy via ChatKit or download SDK code

**Workflow Structure:**
1. **Design** - Build workflow in Agent Builder
2. **Publish** - Create versioned workflow object with ID
3. **Deploy** - Embed with ChatKit or use Agents SDK

---

## 🎯 How It Should Work

### Start Node Behavior
**Purpose:** Define inputs to workflow

**For Chat Workflows:**
1. Appends user input to conversation history
2. Exposes `input_as_text` variable
3. Can add state variables

**Key Feature:** All chat start nodes have `input_as_text` as input variable

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ No `input_as_text` variable
- ❌ Variables not connected to execution
- ❌ Hardcoded input instead of dynamic

---

### Agent Node Behavior
**Purpose:** Define instructions, tools, model config

**Best Practices:**
- Keep each agent well-defined in scope
- Add model behavior instructions
- Pipe output from previous steps as context
- Can have multiple agent nodes

**Tool Integration:**
- Agents can be equipped with tools
- Tools are selected and configured
- Tools execute during agent processing

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ "+ Add tool" button non-functional
- ❌ No tool selection UI
- ❌ Tools not integrated with execution

---

### Note Node Behavior
**Purpose:** Leave comments and explanations

**Key Feature:** 
- Doesn't execute in workflow
- Just documentation for team

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Note node not registered
- ❌ Shows as generic fallback

---

### File Search Node
**Purpose:** Retrieve data from vector stores

**Features:**
- Search by vector store ID
- Add query for what to search
- Use variables from previous nodes
- Supports multiple file types

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Node not registered
- ❌ Vector store integration missing

---

### Guardrails Node
**Purpose:** Monitor for unwanted inputs

**Features:**
- Detect PII, jailbreaks, hallucinations
- Pass/fail testing
- Define what happens on failure
- First wave of protection

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Node not registered
- ❌ No guardrails implementation

---

### MCP Node
**Purpose:** Call third-party tools and services

**Features:**
- Connect with OpenAI connectors
- Third-party servers
- Custom servers
- Read/search data in other apps (Gmail, Zapier)

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ MCP node exists
- ❌ Not registered in React Flow
- ✅ MCP server list in palette (expandable)

---

### If/Else Node
**Purpose:** Add conditional logic

**Features:**
- Uses CEL (Common Expression Language)
- Route based on classifications
- Multiple output paths

**Example Use:**
- If Q&A → route to Q&A agent
- If open-ended → route to research agent
- Else → end workflow

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ If/Else node registered and working
- ✅ Has condition editor
- ✅ Supports branching

---

### While Node
**Purpose:** Loop on custom conditions

**Features:**
- Uses CEL expressions
- Check if condition still true
- Safety limit for iterations

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ While node registered and working
- ✅ Has condition editor
- ✅ Has max iterations setting
- ✅ Loop structure documented

---

### Human Approval Node
**Purpose:** Defer to end-users for approval

**Features:**
- Human review before action
- Confirmation prompts
- Useful for sensitive operations

**Example Use:**
- Agent drafts email
- Human approval node asks "Send this?"
- If approved → MCP node sends via Gmail

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Node not registered
- ❌ No approval UI

---

### Transform Node
**Purpose:** Reshape outputs

**Features:**
- Convert types (object → array)
- Enforce schema adherence
- Make data readable for downstream agents

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Node not registered
- ❌ Shows as generic fallback

---

### Set State Node
**Purpose:** Define global variables

**Features:**
- Create variables from agent outputs
- Use throughout workflow
- Global state management

**Our Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Node not registered
- ❌ No state management

---

## 🔒 Safety Features (Critical!)

### 1. Prompt Injection Protection
**Risk:** Malicious text overrides AI instructions

**Mitigations:**
- Don't use untrusted variables in developer messages
- Pass untrusted inputs through user messages
- Use structured outputs to constrain data flow
- Define enums, fixed schemas, required fields

### 2. Private Data Leakage
**Risk:** Agent shares private data unintentionally

**Mitigations:**
- Control what data goes to MCPs
- Use guardrails to limit context
- Review tool calls before execution

### 3. Best Practices
- Use GPT-5 or GPT-5-mini (more robust)
- Keep tool approvals ON
- Use guardrails for user inputs
- Run trace graders and evals
- Combine multiple techniques

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Preview and Debug
- Interactive workflow testing
- Attach sample files
- Observe execution of each node
- Real-time debugging

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Run button works
- ✅ Execution logs show
- ❌ No file attachment
- ❌ No step-by-step observation

### Evaluate
- Run trace graders
- Select traces for assessment
- Custom graders for performance
- Workflow-level evaluation

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Evaluate button exists
- ✅ Shows basic metrics
- ❌ No trace grading
- ❌ No custom graders

### Code Export
- View workflow as code
- Copy for implementation
- Two deployment options:
  1. ChatKit (recommended)
  2. Advanced integration (Agents SDK)

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Code button works
- ✅ Shows workflow JSON
- ✅ Copy to clipboard
- ❌ No SDK code generation

### Publish/Version
- Auto-saves as you work
- Publish creates major version
- Version acts as snapshot
- Can specify version in API calls

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Save button works (localStorage)
- ❌ No versioning system
- ❌ No publish workflow
- ❌ No version history

- Tool execution integration
- Multiple tool types (File Search, MCP, etc.)

### 3. Safety is Not Optional
OpenAI emphasizes safety throughout. We need:
- Guardrails implementation
- Human approval nodes
- Structured outputs
- Input validation

### 4. Data Flow is Key
Workflows need to pass data between nodes. We need:
- Variable system
- Transform capabilities
- State management
- Type checking

### 5. User Experience Matters
OpenAI provides excellent UX. We need:
- Clear node configuration
- Helpful tooltips
- Error messages
- Preview capabilities
