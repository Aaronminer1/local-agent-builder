# 🔧 WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT FIXES

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Problem 1: ❌ Can't Name New Workflows
**Before:** Creating a new workflow had no way to set a name  
**After:** ✅ Save dialog prompts for workflow name and description

### Problem 2: ❌ Saving Overwrites Existing Workflows
**Before:** Clicking "Save" always saved to the same ID, overwriting workflows  
**After:** ✅ Each workflow gets a unique ID (`workflow-{timestamp}`)

### Problem 3: ❌ Workflows Not Loading Properly
**Before:** Opening a workflow showed empty canvas or wrong data  
**After:** ✅ Workflows load with their actual saved nodes and edges

### Problem 4: ❌ Default Workflow Had No Data
**Before:** "Advanced AI Research Assistant" was just a placeholder  
**After:** ✅ Default workflow has actual nodes and edges

## How It Works Now

### Creating a New Workflow

1. Click "Create New Workflow" on `/workflows` page
2. Navigates to `/builder/new`
3. Starts with a blank canvas (2 default nodes)
4. Click "Save" → Save dialog appears
5. Enter name and description
6. Workflow gets unique ID: `workflow-{timestamp}`
7. Saved to localStorage with all data
8. URL updates to `/builder/{id}`

### Opening an Existing Workflow

1. Click on workflow card in `/workflows` list
2. Navigates to `/builder/{id}`
3. Loads workflow data from localStorage
4. Displays correct nodes, edges, name
5. Workflow name appears in TopBar

### Saving Changes

**First-time save (new workflow):**
- Shows save dialog
- Prompts for name + description
- Creates new ID
- Adds to workflows list

**Updating existing workflow:**
- Uses current workflow ID
- Updates the existing workflow data
- Updates workflows list metadata
- Shows confirmation

## Data Structure

### Individual Workflow (localStorage key: `agent-builder-workflow-{id}`)
```json
{
  "id": "workflow-1728508800000",
  "name": "Customer Support Agent",
  "description": "Handles customer inquiries with AI",
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...],
  "version": "1.0",
  "savedAt": "2025-10-09T20:30:00.000Z",
  "nodeCount": 5
}
```

### Workflows List (localStorage key: `agent-builder-workflows`)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "default",
    "name": "Advanced AI Research Assistant",
    "description": "Comprehensive research workflow",
    "savedAt": "2025-10-09T20:00:00.000Z",
    "nodeCount": 2,
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  {
    "id": "workflow-1728508800000",
    "name": "Customer Support Agent",
    "description": "Handles customer inquiries with AI",
    "savedAt": "2025-10-09T20:30:00.000Z",
    "nodeCount": 5,

## localStorage Commands (for debugging)

### View all workflows
```javascript
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('agent-builder-workflows')));
```

### View specific workflow
```javascript
const id = 'default'; // or any workflow ID
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`agent-builder-workflow-${id}`)));
```

### Clear all workflows (start fresh)
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('agent-builder-workflows');
// Then remove each individual workflow
localStorage.removeItem('agent-builder-workflow-default');
// Reload page to reinitialize
```

### List all workflow keys
```javascript
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('agent-builder')).forEach(k => {
  console.log(k, localStorage.getItem(k).substring(0, 100) + '...');
});
```
