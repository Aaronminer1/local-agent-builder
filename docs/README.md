## 📚 Documentation Structure

All documentation is organized in this `/docs` folder:

```
docs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── CURRENT_STATUS.md - Current state, bugs, and priorities
├── TESTING.md - All test results and findings
├── IMPLEMENTATION.md - Implementation guide and roadmap
└── REFERENCE.md - OpenAI comparison and reference
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Links

### For Developers:
- **[Current Status](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)** - What works, what doesn't, what's next
- **[Testing Guide](./TESTING.md)** - How to test, known bugs, test results
- **[Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - How to implement features

### For Reference:
- **[OpenAI Comparison](./REFERENCE.md)** - How we compare to OpenAI's Agent Builder
- **[Main README](../README.md)** - Project overview and setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Want to know what's working?** → Read [CURRENT_STATUS.md](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)
2. **Found a bug?** → Check [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) to see if it's known
3. **Want to add a feature?** → Follow [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)

## 📋 What Happened to All Those Files?

We had **48 markdown files** scattered everywhere! They've been consolidated into 4 focused documents:

### Consolidated Files:
- ✅ All bug reports → `TESTING.md`
- ✅ All status updates → `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- ✅ All implementation plans → `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ✅ All OpenAI analysis → `REFERENCE.md`

### Archived Files:
Old files moved to `/docs/archive/` for reference but not actively maintained.

## 🎯 One Source of Truth

**CURRENT_STATUS.md** is the single source of truth for:
- ✅ What's working
- ❌ What's broken
- 🔄 What's in progress
- 📋 What's next

**Always check CURRENT_STATUS.md first!**
